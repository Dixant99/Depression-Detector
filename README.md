# Depression-Detector
Psychological problems in college students like depression, pessimism, eccentricity, anxiety, etc. are caused principally due to the neglect of continuous monitoring of students' psychological well-being. Identification of depression at the college level is desirable so that it can be controlled at the starting stage itself. In this system, an attempt is being made to make use of the Image processing techniques, to study the frontal face features of college students and predict depression.
